learning to use github
This is so cool!! Known about Github for some time, well, since I started reading up on the whole code-thing, but it sounded lilke an intimidating space for amateur coders like me. SO, I've never tried it until today because I want to upload an image to a Codepen and you can't do it in the free version. Google said I should upload my icon to a Github repo and then to Codepen - VIOLA! and that is how I ended up learning and using Github.
